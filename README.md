# VBScript Empty/Null Handling in Function
This example showcases potential unexpected behavior related to the Empty keyword and function return values in VBScript. The code demonstrates how the function handles various data types, including numeric values, dates, strings and empty values.  The key focus is on the difference in behavior depending on whether an explicit return value is set or omitted, and how Empty and Null might be treated differently in these situations.  Pay close attention to the function's behavior with the Empty argument and how the output reflects VBScript's default behavior when no explicit return value is set within the If/Else block.
